
Thoughts on how to fix the tile refresh error when reversing on movement selection:
MAYBE it's because the overlays are being drawn fucked up, then getting fixed on the next draw. If I increase the draw
rate, that'll fix it. Alternatively, I can have a special flag for double-draws. That'll limit redraws to only when
absolutely necessary?

Both seem valid at 2am.

New issues... Spells. I have the basic class template set up, but accessing them is tricky since they're so different
from regular attacks. My current thought is I'll need to spawn a custom menu for spells... Like, click left and right
to change the current level selected. This custom menu would be tailored to tell the battlefield what it needed to do
and wouldn't hugely bastardize the existing attack/built-in command distributor. I dunno.

Sprite List
Battlefield = background
movement_overlay = 0
movement_arrows = 1
